A responsive and interactive [web portfolio](https://davidjeong.xyz) made by me, all coded from scratch.

Built with NEXT.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and React Rough Notation.

All images used have been taken and edited by me, except for the image used in `<ContactMe />` section,
which was AI-generated with the prompt created by me.

## Updates:

### 2023-11-14

✅ Added `<title>` tags for each page.

✅ Added a `<HeadTag>` component to change to a custom favicon and allow dynamic input of `<title>` tags by page.

## Next Steps:

☐ Add a section for publications

☐ Add a section to list short blog posts

☐ Add a dark mode feature
